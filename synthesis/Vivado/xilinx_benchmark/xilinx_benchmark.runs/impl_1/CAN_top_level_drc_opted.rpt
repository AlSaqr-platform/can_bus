2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
161 out of 161 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: adress[23], adress[22], adress[21], adress[20], adress[19], adress[18], adress[17], adress[16], adress[11], adress[10], adress[9], adress[8], adress[7], adress[6], adress[5] (the first 15 of 33 listed).
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
161 out of 161 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: adress[23], adress[22], adress[21], adress[20], adress[19], adress[18], adress[17], adress[16], adress[11], adress[10], adress[9], adress[8], adress[7], adress[6], adress[5] (the first 15 of 33 listed).

CHECK-3#1 Warning
Report rule limit reached  
REQP-1840 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
Related violations: <none>

IOCNT-1#1 Warning
Number of IOs  
The design contains 161 unplaced I/O ports while the target device, xc7z007sclg225-2, has 54 remaining available user I/O pins. This DRC assumes that all ports which do not drive MGT pins should be placed on user I/O pins. To correct this issue:
1. Ensure you are targeting the correct device and package. Select a larger device or different package if necessary.
2. Check the top-level ports of the design to ensure the correct number of ports are specified.
3. Consider design changes to reduce the number of user I/O pins needed.

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 txt_buf_comp_gen[0].txtBuffer_comp/txt_buffer_mem_reg has an input control pin txt_buf_comp_gen[0].txtBuffer_comp/txt_buffer_mem_reg/ADDRARDADDR[6] (net: txt_buf_comp_gen[0].txtBuffer_comp/ADDRARDADDR[1]) which is driven by a register (reg_comp/txt_buf_prior_reg[0][0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
